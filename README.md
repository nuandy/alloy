# Alloy

The Alloy project began when I needed to integrate with eBay's developers API and there were very few resources online that showed you how. Alloy will show how to list an item for sale on eBay using various programming languages. The first language being PHP and the next being Ruby.

Other sales channels in the works are Amazon, Yahoo, Google Base and more.

Step by Step instructions will be added soon...
