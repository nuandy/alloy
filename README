This project is ongoing...

The idea is to export inventory from a database to all online sales channels.

The database can be relational, object/document based, or even a flat file.

Sales channels include eBay, Amazon, Yahoo, Buy.com, Google Base, Etsy, Craigslist, Shopzilla, BizRate, PriceGrabber, Shopping.com, NexTag etc.
Every attempt will be made to add integration support for additional sales channels.

The programming language or framework used is up to you.
